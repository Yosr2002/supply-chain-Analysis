Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard ðŸ“¦ðŸ“ˆ
Just IN-Time company

 I. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project provides end-to-end supply chain analytics for a fictional company "Just In Time." As the lead data analyst, I focused on identifying inefficiencies in shipping, inventory, and product performance. The goal was to create interactive dashboards that allow business stakeholders to understand challenges and take action to optimize operations.

 II. METHODOLOGY

- Business Demand: Analyze sales, inventory, and shipping operations
- Analysis Type: Descriptive, Exploratory, Diagnostic
- Tools Used: 
  - Power query (Data cleaning, preprocessing, EDA)
  - Power BI (Interactive Dashboards)

 Key Stakeholders:
- Sales Manager: Get insights into net sales, customers, and top-performing products.
- Shipping Manager: Analyze on-time vs late shipments, shipment delays, and modes.
- Inventory Manager: Track storage cost, inventory turnover, and product distribution.

 III. DASHBOARDS OVERVIEW

 1. Executive Summary Dashboard
- KPIs:
  - Net Sales: $5M+
  - Discount Amount: $520K
  - Customers: 7.4K

 IV. FINDINGS

- High profit margin (~72%), but a sharp decline in net sales in 2017 due to potential supply chain disruption
- High late shipment rate (~40%)consistently across departments and years
- Missing popular departments like Apparel and Golf from inventory suggest a strategic or logistical issue
- Some best-selling items also have the **longest replenishment time**
  Same Day & First Class shipment modes still have late deliveries â€” inefficiency in fulfillment

 V. CONCLUSION

The analysis and dashboards help stakeholders:

- Monitor and assess key performance metrics
- Identify operational inefficiencies
- Optimize inventory strategy
- Improve shipping performance
